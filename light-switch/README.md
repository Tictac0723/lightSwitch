## Light Switch Application

I used create-react-app and material-ui to build this coding challenge. For this challenge, I needed to build out a react application that held a light switch that the user could turn on and off. I decided to use material-ui for a clean look and feel. 


To get the app started:
1. git clone the repo
2. Run the following commands in terminal 
* npm install
* npm start

and then you are ready to go!
