## Light Switch Application

I used create-react-app and material-ui to build this coding challenge. For this challenge, I needed to build out a react application that held a light switch that the user could turn on and off. I decided to use material-ui for a clean look and feel. 

#To get started
1. git clone the repo
2. open terminal
3. run npm install
4. run npm start
